Frustum culling is a technique used in computer graphics to improve performance by determining which objects in a 3D scene are visible within the camera's view frustum and should be rendered, and which objects are outside the frustum and can be skipped.

This video shows that whenever the bird is inside the player's view, it is rendered, and otherwise, it is removed from the scene.

To make it more clear , I added console logs
